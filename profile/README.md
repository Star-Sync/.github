# StarSync

Satellites enable navigation, communication, and weather forecasting by connecting with ground stations to share data, needing smart coordination for smooth operations. StarSync, created with the Canadian Space Agency, transforms this with a system enabling scheduling requests and handling conflicts seamlessly, all through an easy-to-use interface. Moving beyond the outdated manual approach, it reduces errors, saves time, and grows with demand. By improving how satellite communications are planned and managed, StarSync empowers mission planners with a reliable, efficient tool that enhances accuracy and supports the future of space exploration.
